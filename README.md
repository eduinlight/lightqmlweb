# LightQmlWeb (LQW)

QML is the best language that I learn to build desktops applications in a fast way. LQW is an union of three projects qmlweb(https://github.com/qmlweb/qmlweb), qmlweb-parser(https://github.com/qmlweb/qmlweb-parser) and gulp-qmlweb(https://github.com/qmlweb/gulp-qmlweb). I'm going bring you a fast way to use qmlweb and of course I'm going to implement more modules but not necessary modules from QT but usefulls modules for frontend web development.

# Future works

Implementation of routes managment, bootstrap and materialize support and forms validations.
