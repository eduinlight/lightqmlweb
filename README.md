# QMLWEB development

This is a QML parser in pure JavaScript, based on UglifyJS parser.

It serves both as an optional dependency to
[QmlWeb](https://github.com/qmlweb/qmlweb) to allow it parse QML and
JavaScript files in runtime and as a parser that powers
[gulp-qmlweb](https://github.com/qmlweb/gulp-qmlweb) to pre-parse
files before serving them to the browser.
